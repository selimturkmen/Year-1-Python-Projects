Python Projects and School Assignments from my first year in University


                                                                            A1: The Tortoise and the Hare

Submitted to Dr. Ting Hu at Queen’s University Faculty of Computing
This assignment idea belongs to Dr. Ting Hu

Code is written by Selim Turkmen under instructions of Dr. Ting Hu’s assignment guidelines

This program re-creates the classic race of the tortoise and the hare and uses random number generation to develop a simulation of this. There are 70 squares and both the tortoise and the hare start square 1, and through a random number generation, their movement will be decided. Their movement can be good (moving up a number of squares) or harmful (slipping down a number of squares). This will happen by generating a random number from 1-10, and computing which movement will take place depending on the number. If they are tied, print OUCH!!!
